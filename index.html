<p>This is code I wrote for the Engineering Honors Class during my junior year at St. Paul's School. Below is a summary adapted from the EH materials.</p>

<p>The program’s goal is to allow the most talented 11th-grade engineering students to get an
experience beyond the standard high school engineering curriculum. Students will research and apply for
internship positions in Engineering laboratories. Those who are successful in securing an internship invitation from a lab or company will be admitted to the Advanced Engineering spring course. </p>

<p>Students cover advanced topics in Engineering in a seminar, however the primary goal is to have the students coordinate with their summer lab to train themselves in the skills and knowledge they will need in order to arrive at the lab ready to be productive.</p>

<p>During the fall term of the student’s 12th-grade, students will present the results of their summer research. The students will also engage in an engineering capstone project. This will either involve continuing the summer research (if this can be done at school) or proposing and working on a new project.</p>
